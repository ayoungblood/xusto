lang2d Readme
=============

lang2d is a draft of an esoteric, stack-based, interpreted, reflective computer programming language. All data is 8 bits. Instructions are single characters, arranged in a grid, through which program execution flows. In this respect, it is a funge (a variant of Befunge). However, it extends typical funge behavior by adding an extended instruction set, and an execution space that can be mutated during program execution. The program space is best visualized as a torus whose joins can be rotated by an arbitrary offset.
