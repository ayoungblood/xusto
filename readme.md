lang2d Readme
=============

lang2d is a draft of an esoteric, stack-based, interpreted, reflective computer programming language. All data is 8 bits. There is a stack and a heap. Instructions are single characters, arranged in a grid, through which program execution flows. In this respect, it is a funge (a variant of Befunge). However, it extends typical funge behavior by adding a heap, an extended instruction set, and a modified execution space. Instead of Lahey-space, as is used by Befunge, it uses a circular, extendable space whose behavior can be modified by the program at runtime.
